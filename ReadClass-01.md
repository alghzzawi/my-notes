# Introduction to React and Components

## | - component

1. A component is a modular, replaceable. extensible, reusable set of well-defined classes. A component is a software object used to activate other components or encapsulate functions. It has a clearly defined interface and conforms to the common recommended behavior of all components within the build.

2. 
  * Reusability: Components are usually designed for reuse in different situations and some components are designed for a specific task.

  * Replaceable: It can be replaced with other components.

  * Extensible: can be added to the component to provide a new behavior

3. With the availability of new versions, it is possible to replace the current version without any impact on other components. Allows component development without affecting other parts of the system.

 

||- react-props

1. Props is a special keyword in React, and it is used to pass data from one enabler to another, but it is passed unilaterally, so we have the parent pass his data to the child

2. define an attribute and its value, then pass it to child component by using props, then pass it to child component by using Props, last thing render the Props Data

3. Props are used as input to a view to determine its output. The view also calls the diff algorithm which recognizes any changes in the component and logs them for assembly in the DOM.
