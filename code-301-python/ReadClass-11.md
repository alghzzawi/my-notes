Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases: #### |ID|SQL|NoSQL| |—|—|—| |01| primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|primarily called as non-relational or distributed database| |03|table based databases|document based, key-value pairs| |04|have predefined schema| have dynamic schema for unstructured data| |05|vertically scalable whereas|horizontally scalable| # #
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Best fit for heavy duty transactional type applications.
#

Give a real world example.
Customers and sales, what the customer purchased and the customer info.
# #

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Objects, which contains key-pair value.
#

Give a real world example.
Facebook friends-list database
#

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
SQL
# -Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL
# # #

What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language.
#

What is a relational database?
A database structured to recognize relations between stored items of information.
#

#

How does it work?
Store data in documents rather than relational tables.
#

What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections.
#

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB as it ensures high and diverse data availability
#

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
No reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
