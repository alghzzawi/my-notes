# Testing and Modules

* ### the TDD stands for Test-Driven Development. It's like a method utilized in the mean time composing the code and for testing causes some time recently implementation. It has benefits such as ease of reading and in the event that name == "main" is like an figure of speech, it permits to execute code when the file runs as a script, but not when itâ€™s imported as a module

* ### Script: When run as a script, your code prompts the client for input, calls echo(), and prints the result.By executing the in case name == "main" expression in your code, you set up an extra section point that permits you to utilize echo() right from the command line. in case it's true; at that point the indented code taking after the conditional statement executes, in the event that untrue; Python skips the indented code.

* ### Each recursive function must have a base condition that stops the recursion or else the function calls itself interminably. The Python translator limits the depths of recursion to assist dodge unbounded recursions, coming about in stack floods. Recursion makes the code clean, and complex assignments can be broken down into sub-problems.
