__What is authentication?__

Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it says it is. Authentication technology provides access control for systems by checking to see if a user's credentials match the credentials in a database of authorized users or in a data authentication server. In doing this, authentication assures secure systems, secure processes and enterprise information security.

Authentication factors can even go further than SFA, which requires a user ID and password, or 2FA, which requires a user ID, password and biometric signature. When three or more identity verification factors are used for authentication -- for example, a user ID and password, biometric signature and perhaps a personal question the user must answer -- it is called multifactor authentication (MFA).

__Why is authentication important in cybersecurity?__

Authentication enables organizations to keep their networks secure by permitting only authenticated users or processes to gain access to their protected resources. This may include computer systems, networks, databases, websites and other network-based applications or services.

Once authenticated, a user or process is usually subjected to an authorization process to determine whether the authenticated entity should be permitted access to a specific protected resource or system. A user can be authenticated but not be given access to a specific resource if that user was not granted permission to access it.

__How does authentication work?__

During authentication, credentials provided by the user are compared to those on file in a database of authorized users' information either on the local operating system server or through an authentication server. If the credentials entered match those on file and the authenticated entity is authorized to use the resource, the user is granted access. User permissions determine which resources the user gains access to and also any other access rights that are linked to the user, such as during which hours the user can access the resource and how much of the resource the user is allowed to consume.

Traditionally, authentication was accomplished by the systems or resources being accessed. For example, a server would authenticate users using its own password system, login IDs, or usernames and passwords.

__What is authentication used for?__

User and process authentication are used to ensure that only authorized individuals or processes are allowed to access company IT resources. Depending on the use cases for which authentication is used, authentication can consist of either SFA, 2FA or MFA.

The most common implementation of authentication is SFA, which requires a user ID and a password for sign-on and access. However, since banks and many companies now use online banking and e-commerce to conduct business and store customer Social Security and credit and debit card numbers
