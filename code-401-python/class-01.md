# Linked Lists 
### Linear data structure is like a hopscotch game: in arrange to reach the conclusion of the list we have to be go through all the things within the list. Linked lists are straight data structures. The greatest distinction between arrays and linked lists is the way they utilize memory in our devices. The linked list can be straightforward, double and circular lists, and the sort of lists shows the direction of navigation. A linked list comprises of a arrangement of nodes, which are the components of the list. Linked lists must have a header, since this can be viably the as it were section point to the list and all of its components, and the conclusion of the list isn't a node point to null, or invalid.
